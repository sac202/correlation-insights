----> Correlation Analysis in Python

This project performs a detailed correlation analysis using Python on a dataset containing various features. The main goal is to understand how different numerical variables relate to each other using correlation coefficients and visualizations like heatmaps.

----> Project Overview

- Loaded and preprocessed a dataset using `pandas`
- Converted categorical features into numerical codes
- Calculated correlation matrix (`Pearson`, `Kendall`, `Spearman`)
- Visualized the correlation using seaborn heatmaps
- Identified and interpreted strong/weak correlations between features

----> Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

----> Visualizations

- Correlation Heatmaps
- Pairwise plots (optional)
- Feature vs Target correlation analysis

----> What Youâ€™ll Learn

- How to preprocess data for correlation analysis
- How to handle categorical features
- When to use different correlation methods
- How to visualize correlations for better insight
